## Big-O Guide 

### Cheat sheet

- Calculation not dependent on input size - O(1)
- 1 loop - O(n)
- 2 nested loops - O(n²)
- Input size reduced by half - O(logn)

> Answer : Big-O O(1) : Constant

# Recusrion

- What?

> Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem

> Recursion is when a function calls itself

- Why?

> A great technique to simplify your solution

> If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller versions of the same problem, recursion is very useful
